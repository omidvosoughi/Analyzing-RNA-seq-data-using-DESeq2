# Analyzing-RNA-seq-data-using-DESeq2
## Differential expression analysis
This hands-on project adapted from DESeq2 <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html" target="_blank">Vignette</a>.

I used RNA-seq data from the ENCODE project. They sequenced embryonic mouse (liver and forebrain) in two embryonic stages (11.5 and 12.5 days). The sequencing data represents the raw read counts per gene.

The aim is to find genes differential expressed in liver and forebrain.
